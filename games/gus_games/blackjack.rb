#Blackjack!

##Objective
#Practice conditional logic including nested conditionals. 
#Use methods to keep our code DRY.

##Instructions
#We are going to build a command line blackjack game.  A player gets dealt two cards which have values between 1-11.  
# After they get dealt two cards you should show them the total score of their cards and ask them if they want to hit or stay. 
# A player is allowed to "hit" up to two times.  After each hit you should ask if they want to hit or stay and display the total value of their cards. 
# If they don't want to hit, and they are not at 21 they lose.  Your program should tell them they lose and exit.
			
#Note:  To take input from the person "playing" the game your program will have to use the Ruby method "gets".

##Challenge
#After successfully completing the previous game (there should be a commit with a working version of this game),
#alter the game so that a player can "hit" as many times as they want.

def card
  1 + rand(11)
end
        

def blackjack
  puts "This is blackjack."
  card1 = card
  card2 = card
  total_cards = card1 + card2
  puts "Your cards are #{card1} and #{card2}. It gives you the total of #{total_cards}."

  while total_cards < 21
    puts "Do you want to hit or stay?"
    answer = gets.chomp
    if answer == "hit"
      new_card = card 
      total_cards += new_card
      puts " Your new card is #{new_card} and now you have in your hand a total of #{total_cards}"
    else
      break
    end
  end

  if total_cards > 21
    puts "You have more than 21 so you lose"
  elsif total_cards == 21
    puts "You win"
  else
    puts "You don't have 21 so you lose"
  end
