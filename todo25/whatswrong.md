----
the page is basically made up of nested h3 tags.

the page was probably made around 1996. i think this because the top of the html code says "<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC... HTML 3.2...>" and according to http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html32 HTML version 3.2 "aims to capture recommended pratice as of early '96." so, probably 1996 era.
