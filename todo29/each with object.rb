# Instructions:
# Each with object works much like inject. Use each_with_object to return an array containing one reversed string for each string that has an even number of characters.

# Code:
def even_sum(arr)
  arr.each_with_object([]) { |string, array| array << string.reverse if string.length % 2 == 0 }
end

# even_sum(["cat", "dog", "bird", "fish"]) #=> ["drib", "hsif"]
